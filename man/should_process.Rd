\title{Check If Data Processing Should Occur}
\usage{
should_process(raw_data_paths, source_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data_paths}{A character vector or list of paths pointing to the raw data files or directories
to check. Non-character inputs will be coerced to character type.}

\item{source_path}{A character string specifying the path to the source file whose associated RDS
file contains the last known modification time.}
}
\value{
A logical value; `TRUE` if any of the raw data files have been modified after the
        modification date stored in the RDS file, `FALSE` otherwise.
}
\description{
This function determines whether data processing should proceed based on the modification times
of data files relative to a given source file's RDS timestamp. It checks whether any files
in `raw_data_paths` are newer than the timestamp recorded in an RDS file associated with
`source_path`. If no RDS file exists, it treats January 1, 1970 as the reference modification time.
